    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "### Narrative Story\n",
    "Parents, whether you support gun control or not, it is imperative for you to understand the state of gun violence in America. We looked closely at datasets containing information about mass shootings, gun deaths, and school shootings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first finding is that the motivation behind 64% of mass shooting incidents is due to emotional stress. Emotional stress includes reasons such as a domestic dispute, anger, psychological issues and more. It is extremely dangerous when people can easily have access to guns during an emotional breakdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our second finding, we found that children are the biggest victim group of homicide and the smallest victim group of suicide. This is an important issue because children do not have any voice in the topic of gun control, yet, they are the group that suffers the most consequence under gun violence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, we see a trend of the incline in school shootings since 1970. One possible reason is that handgun is the most used weapon and they are very easy to conceal. Classroom is a confined space that makes children extremely vulnerable.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of these findings, we urge you to carefully think about the topic of gun control. You have the power to make a difference and create a better world for our children."

    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "We found that over 64% of mass-shootings from 1966 to 2017 were due to problems such as a domestic dispute, anger, and psychological issues. We categorize these problems as the emotional stress of the shooter. Since guns are easy to obtain, people can utilize it when they experience some sort of mental breakdown. If someone exhibits dangerous behavior before the shooting and the motivation was emotional, we should have laws that capitalize on that window and take away gun possession from the potential shooter, especially when a lot of child victims come from these types of incidents."

    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "Our second visualization shows a terrifying fact that minor age group has the highest rate of being a victim of firearm homicide. The homicide rate is decreased when age is increasing and leads to senior citizens are more likely to die in suicide caused by a firearm. The topic we want to lead out is that the severity of gun violence impacts on United States children and teenagers. According to gun-death dataset, 58 percent are killed by gun-related homicides-about 1,100 per year. Minors are not allowed to vote for firearms control and they are the largest group of gun violence victims. Parents should be aware of how gun violence affects their children and speak up for their kids. Among wealthy, industrialized countries, 91 percent of children under 15 killed by guns die in the United States, according to the National Institutes of Health. The same report found that young Americans (ages 15 to 24) are 49 times more likely to die by gunfire than their peers in other high-income countries. (Kerry Shaw, 2017)"

    "### Analysis\n",
    "Originally, we looked at mass shootings in open and closed areas and found that there are more shootings in closed areas. This makes sense because it is harder to escape in a confined space. The total victims' numbers are much higher than outside building area. Additionally, much inside building tragedy happened in establishments such as school or church; places where minors often go to. We extended this analysis to look strictly into campus shooting. We found that the number of school shootings has been increasing in the last 3 decades. Additionally, we found that handgun is the most used weapon compare to other types of firearm.\n",
    "\n",
    "School is often a confined space and people are most likely to be trapped in classrooms. Handgun is the most used weapon because it is easy to conceal. The result is more shooting in schools because the shooter can easily hide a gun to school and students are easy targets."

    "Literature inspiration: From [Are School Shootings Becoming More Frequent? We Ran The Numbers](https://www.ideastream.org/news/are-school-shootings-becoming-more-frequent-we-ran-the-numbers) article, since the shooting at Columbine High School in April 1999 there have been 68 school shootings. From 2015 to 2018, the U.S. averaged a school shooting every 77 days.  \n",

    "The first step is to import this dataset into Tableau. Since we want to see the number of shooting on campus across the years. We set the Date as Columns and Number of records as Rows. And we want to see the trend, a trend line is better for the audience to read. Then, the grid in the background is unnecessary here, so we deleted them to make the data-ink ratio higher.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing we want to figure out is how did the shooter get into the campus with weapons, and their purpose of hurt these kids. So we decided to try the Firearm Types to look deep into these shootings, and we found that there are some similar values such as “Handguns” and “Multiple Handguns”. Then we started to consider group them into several groups.  \n",

    "Our first group method is grouping them into “Handguns”, “Rifles”, and “Others”. But the result turns out that “handguns”  were used the most, but “Others” became the second large group. This might cause confusion and the audience may doubt the accuracy of our dataset. So we changed the group method.  \n",

    "Our final group method is grouping them into “Handguns”, “Rifles”, “Combination of Weapons” , “Shotgun” and “Others”. We decide not to change the structure of original values, just group the same ones, such as  “Handguns” and “Multiple Handguns”, and deleted the “Unknowns”. We found that handguns which are easy to conceal is the biggest killer in the shootings on campus, they cause the most number of injured and killed victims.\n"

This dataset includes information about gun-death in the US in the years 2012-2014. The data includes data regarding the victim's age, sex, race, education, intent, time (month and year) and place of death, and whether or not police was at the place of death.  \n",

Mass Shootings in the United States of America (1966-2017) The US has witnessed 398 mass shootings in last 50 years that resulted in 1,996 deaths and 2,488 injured. The latest and the worst mass shooting of October 2, 2017 killed 58 and injured 515 so far. The number of people injured in this attack is more than the number of people injured in all mass shootings of 2015 and 2016 combined. The average number of mass shootings per year is 7 for the last 50 years that would claim 39 lives and 48 injured per year.  \n",

And we downloaded the data from 1970 to 2019(Present), 1374 records in total. Because the dataset is pretty clean, we insert the data directly into Tableau.\n"

    "d. Establishing safe and equitable campus to reduce gun violence impacting on children, especially in high-risk communities.\n",
    "e. Building a supportive school environment. Instead of hardening the school, it is better to lower the background levels of bullying and discrimination and track the data and perform threat assessments on potential risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggestion 2**: Parents suggestions to gun control group\n",
    "a. Pass Red Flag Laws. Red Flag laws is that law enforcement and family members can act on warning signs of violence, like those that repeatedly occurred in Parkland, and temporarily prevent access to firearms;\n",
    "b. Encourage and propagandize responsible firearm storage\n",
    "c. Raise the firearms sales tax and establish a safe campus program that uses part of sales tax generating from gun sales to support the program expenses.\n"
