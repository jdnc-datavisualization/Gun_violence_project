# Gun_violence_project

This is a team project for **MSIS 2629: Dashboards, Scorecards, and Visualization**. The objective of the team project is to collaboratively develop a data product that is repeatable, inspectable, reusable, and diffable (i.e., you can see changes over time). A data product makes a complex data-driven argument using several data visualizations.
